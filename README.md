# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Heatmap

[Live App](https://blackscholesheatmap.streamlit.app/)

## Overview
A Python-based interactive application that visualizes **call and put option prices** using the Black-Scholes model. Users can explore how option prices vary with different input parameters through dynamic heatmaps, making complex financial concepts intuitive and visually accessible. 
This project was fully implemented by me through reverse-engineering the existing app (link below). No AI assistance was used.

## Key Features
- **Interactive GUI:** Intuitive interface built with Streamlit.  
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Heatmaps update in real-time based on user inputs.  
- **Customizable Parameters:** Set tick density, and define minimum and maximum ranges for analysis.  
- **Supports Call & Put Options:** Visualizes both types of option pricing for comprehensive analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Math
