# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Heatmap

[Live App](https://blackscholesheatmap.streamlit.app/)

## Overview
A Python-based interactive application that visualises **call and put option prices** using the Black-Scholes model. Users can explore how option prices vary with different input parameters through dynamic heatmaps. 
This project was fully implemented by me through reverse-engineering an existing app (link below). No AI assistance was used.

## Key Features
- **Interactive GUI:** Intuitive interface built with Streamlit.  
- **Dynamic Visualisations:** Heatmaps update in real-time based on user inputs.  
- **Customisable Parameters:** Set tick density, and define minimum and maximum ranges for analysis.  
- **Supports Call & Put Options:** Visualises both types of option pricing for comprehensive analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Math
